# Cartopian

Filesystem-first project governance for AI-native development.

Cartopian is a lightweight, protocol-driven project management system
designed for AI agent workflows. It tracks phases, tasks, specs,
decisions, and reviews using plain markdown files and directory-as-status
conventions. No database, no SaaS dependency, no mandatory tooling.

## Design principles

- **Filesystem-first.** Status is a directory. Moving a file is the
  status update. No metadata to sync.
- **Git-optional.** Git versioning can be enabled per project in
  `cartopian.toml`. The protocol works without it.
- **Multi-project workspaces.** Each managed project is a child
  directory under `projects/` with its own config and state. Projects
  are fully isolated from each other.
- **Single projects repo.** All project PM data lives under `projects/`,
  which is its own git repo — one repo for all projects. No per-project
  PM repos, no naming collisions with code repos.
- **AI-native prompts.** The PM produces temporary assignee-directed
  prompts with full context. The operator confirms assignment
  explicitly.
- **Protocol, not methodology.** Best practices are adopted because they
  work, not because a methodology prescribes them.

## Getting started

Cartopian ships with guided skills that AI agents can follow to set up
and plan projects. See `skills/README.md` for the full index.
Cartopian skills can be run using the natural language equivalent of
their filenames (e.g., "init project", "init workspace", "plan project").

- **`skills/init-workspace.md`** — Generate workspace and project config files.
- **`skills/init-project.md`** — Scaffold a new project with the correct structure.
- **`skills/plan-project.md`** — Walk the full lifecycle: requirements → plan → phases → tasks.
- **`skills/run-task.md`** — Drive one task from assignment through review.
- **`skills/run-handoff.md`** — Execute a reusable prompt/report handoff.
- **`skills/close-plan.md`** — Close a completed plan, optionally archive it, and reset for the next planning cycle.

Typical project lifecycle:

```text
init project -> plan project -> run task -> close plan -> plan project
```

## Configuration

**Workspace-level** `cartopian.toml` at the workspace root sets defaults.
**Project-level** `cartopian.toml` in each project directory overrides
defaults and configures project-specific settings.

Run Cartopian's `init-workspace` skill to quickly set these up.

## Roles

Cartopian defines four basic roles configured in `cartopian.toml`:

- **PM** — Drives planning. Produces assignments and proposes assignees.
- **Operator** — Decision-maker. Confirms assignments, gives them to
  assignees, reports progress.
- **Coder** — Implements tasks from assignee prompts.
- **Reviewer** — Reviews artifacts and produces findings.

The same agent can fill multiple roles. Roles are extensible — define
custom roles in `cartopian.toml` as needed.

Role values are kind values that describe the assignee type:

- `human` — manually assigned through the operator.
- `agent` — may be assigned through CLI handoff when configured.
- `none` — role is not used.
- `""` — unset; the PM should ask the operator.

## Automated CLI handoffs

Automation is optional. Manual handoff remains the default.

When a role is set to `agent`, the PM can automate handoffs by
configuring a named executable under `[handoffs.<role>]`:

```toml
[handoffs.coder]
agent = "codex"
auto_start = true
timeout = "60m"
```

The executable convention is:

```text
<agent> <absolute prompt path>
```

Prompt paths are passed as one argument and should be shell-quoted in
manual command examples.

Key design points:

- Tool-specific non-interactive behavior belongs in the executable or
  wrapper, not in Cartopian config.
- Optional handoff timeouts can be set per role.
- PM-authored prompts always use absolute paths.
- Completion reports live at protocol-defined paths under `reports/`.
- Completion reports must redact secrets and sensitive environment values.
- `confirmation = "each-handoff"` is the safe default.
- `confirmation = "until-blocked"` is available for bounded unattended
  runs, but still launches handoffs sequentially.

See `protocol/CONVENTIONS.md` for the handoff contract and
`skills/run-handoff.md` for the executable workflow.
